/**
 * Given an array A[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to N where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count frequency of all elements from 1 to N.

 Note: Expected time complexity is O(n) with O(1) extra space.

 Input Format:
 First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, first line contains an integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

 Output Format:
 For each test case, output N space-separated integers denoting the frequency of each element from 1 to N.

 Your Task:
 You need to complete the function printfrequency and print frequency of each element. The newline is automatically added by the driver code.

 Constraints:
 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
 1 ≤ N ≤ 107
 1 <= A[i] <= 106

 Example:
 Input:
 2
 5
 2 3 2 3 5
 4
 3 3 3 3

 Output:
 0 2 2 0 1
 0 0 4 0

 Explanation:
 Testcase 1: Counting frequencies of each array elements, we have:
 1 occurring 0 times.
 2 occurring 2 times.
 3 occurring 2 times.
 4 occurring 0 times.
 5 occurring 1 time.
