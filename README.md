# ds_algo
Topic wise practice of DSA questions from **GeeksForGeeks** Practice platform.

Generally the code written will be most optimized.
In case you feel, better solution is possible, you are most welcome to raise a Pull Request.

Here is the list of the topics:

-> Arrays

-> BitMagic

-> Dynamic Programming

-> Hashing

-> Mathematics

-> Matrix

-> Queue

-> Recursion

-> Searching

-> Sorting

-> Stack

-> Strings

-> Tree



------------------------
For contributing do create a branch and put a Pull Request.

Contribution motivation:

1. There is a better implementation in terms of space complexity or time complexity

2. Currently it's all in Java, would love to have it in other languages.

3. Increase the readability

4. Provide real world solutions using specific DS.
