Greedy Algo -2

Activity Selection Problem
------------------------------

You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, 
assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.
Example:

Example 1 : Consider the following 3 activities sorted by
by finish time.
     start[]  =  {10, 12, 20};
     finish[] =  {20, 25, 30};
A person can perform at most two activities. The 
maximum set of activities that can be executed 
is {0, 2} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
finish[] ]

Example 2 : Consider the following 6 activities 
sorted by by finish time.
     start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
     finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};
A person can perform at most four activities. The 
maximum set of activities that can be executed 
is {0, 1, 3, 4} [ These are indexes in start[] and 
finish[] ]


Job Sequencing Problem
------------------------
Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit if the job is finished before the deadline. 
It is also given that every job takes the single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. 
How to maximize total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.

Input: Four Jobs with following 
deadlines and profits
JobID  Deadline  Profit
  a      4        20   
  b      1        10
  c      1        40  
  d      1        30
Output: Following is maximum 
profit sequence of jobs
        c, a   


Input:  Five Jobs with following
deadlines and profits
JobID   Deadline  Profit
  a       2        100
  b       1        19
  c       2        27
  d       1        25
  e       3        15
Output: Following is maximum 
profit sequence of jobs
        c, a, e
		
		
Egyptian Fraction
------------------
- Every positive fraction can be represented as sum of unique unit fractions. 
- A fraction is unit fraction if numerator is 1 and denominator is a positive integer, for example 1/3 is a unit fraction.

Egyptian Fraction Representation of 2/3 is 1/2 + 1/6
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 12/13 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 + 1/156

Solution -
- find the greatest possible unit fraction
- recur for the remaining part
consider 6/14, we first find ceiling of 14/6, i.e., 3. So the first unit fraction becomes 1/3, then recur for (6/14 â€“ 1/3) i.e., 4/42.


Huffman Encoding
------------------
- Prefix Codes - code assigned to one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. 
  It makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream.
- Example
	a	0
	b	1
	c 	00
	d 	01
	find - 0001
- Example
character   Frequency
    a            5
    b           9
    c           12
    d           13
    e           16
    f           45
