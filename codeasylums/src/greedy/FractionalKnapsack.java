/**
 * Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item.

 Input:
 N = 3, W = 50
 values[] = {60,100,120}
 weight[] = {10,20,30}
 Output: 240.00
 Explanation: Total maximum value of item
 we can have is 240.00 from the given
 capacity of sack.

 Input:
 N = 2, W = 50
 values[] = {60,100}
 weight[] = {10,20}
 Output: 160.00
 Explanation: Total maximum value of item
 we can have is 160.00 from the given
 capacity of sack.
