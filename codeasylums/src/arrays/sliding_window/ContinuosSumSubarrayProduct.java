/**

 * https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/
 * Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k,
 * write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to a multiple of k,
 * that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an integer.

     Example 1:

     Input: [23, 2, 4, 6, 7],  k=6
     Output: True
     Explanation: Because [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 and sums up to 6.
     Example 2:

     Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
     Output: True
     Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
